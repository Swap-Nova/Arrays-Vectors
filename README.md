# Arrays-Vectors
ðŸŒ  C++ Code that represents an '3-D Array' that contains 2 groups with 4 rows and 3 columns. The aim of the code is to form a group of students in a class by using arrays.  
In a 3-D array the number of dimensions increases so the number of nested braces will also increase. By using the three 'for' loops we are are able to print the output. 

ðŸŒ  C++ Code to add the elements in a 'Vector' by using push_back. Also the using the same elements to add in our 2-D vector. Also we can see that '1000' is not printed because when we add elements to vectors, we make copy of what we are inserting. Therefore, the value of the element is only changed for our 1st element of the 1-D vector.
